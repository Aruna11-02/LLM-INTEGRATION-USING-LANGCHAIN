# LLM LangChain Integration

## Overview
The **LLM LangChain Integration** project showcases the integration of large language models (LLMs) with LangChain to create robust and scalable applications. This repository serves as a comprehensive guide for developers looking to leverage the power of LLMs and LangChain in building advanced NLP systems and applications.

## Features
- Seamless integration with large language models for various NLP tasks.
- Utilizes LangChain for task orchestration and pipeline management.
- Supports tokenization, embeddings, sequence modeling, and other core NLP concepts.
- Implements vector databases like FAISS or Pinecone for efficient data retrieval.
- Demonstrates the use of agents for decision-making tasks.
- Includes examples of integrating external APIs for tasks such as weather forecasting, translation, and finance-related queries.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Framework**: LangChain
- **Libraries**: OpenAI, FAISS, Pinecone, Flask (for API integration)
- **Tools**: VS Code, vector databases, APIs

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10.10 or later
- Basic knowledge of LangChain and NLP concepts (recommended but not mandatory)

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/llm-langchainintegration.git
   cd llm-langchainintegration
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Setup
- Obtain your OpenAI API key and add it to the environment variables:
  ```bash
  export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
  ```
- Configure additional API keys as needed for external integrations.

## Usage
1. Start the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
2. Access the application through the provided interface (e.g., Flask API or CLI).
3. Explore the examples provided in the `examples` directory to understand different use cases.
